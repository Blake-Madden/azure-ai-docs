# Bring your licensed data

::: zone pivot="overview"

Azure AI Agent Service integrates your own licensed data from specialized data providers, 
such as Tripadvisor. Enhance the quality of your agentâ€™s responses with high-quality, fresh data, 
such as travel guidance and reviews. These insights empower your agents to deliver nuanced, informed 
solutions tailored to specific use cases.

We have enabled **Tripadvisor** as the first licensed data provider and you can ground with your licensed 
Tripadvisor data through API, SDK and Azure AI Foundry Portal. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. You are responsible for obtaining license from licensed data provider and bring your license to authorize the connection with the licensed data.
> 2. Grounding with licensed data will incur usage with licensed data providers, please review the pricing plan with your selected licensed data providers.

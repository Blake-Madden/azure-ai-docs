# How to use Azure AI Agent service with OpenAPI Specified Tools

::: zone pivot="overview"

You can now connect your Azure AI Agent to an external API using an OpenAPI 3.0 specified tool, 
allowing for scalable interoperability with various applications. Enable your custom tools 
to authenticate access and connections with managed identities (Microsoft Entra ID) for 
added security, making it ideal for integrating with existing infrastructure or web services.

OpenAPI Specified tool improves your function calling experience by providing standardized, 
automated, and scalable API integrations that enhance the capabilities and efficiency of your agent. 
[OpenAPI specifications](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) provide a formal standard for 
describing HTTP APIs. This allows people to understand how an API works, how a sequence of APIs 
work together, generate client code, create tests, apply design standards, and much, much more. 

## Set up
1. Ensure you've completed the prerequisites and setup steps in the [quickstart](../../quickstart.md).

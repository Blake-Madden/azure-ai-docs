    questions:
      - question: |
          Do you store any data used in the Agent Runtime API? 
        answer: |
          Yes. Unlike Chat Completions API, Azure OpenAI Agent Runtime is a stateful API, meaning it retains data. There are two types of data stored in the Agent Runtime API: 
          * Stateful entities: Threads, messages, and runs created during Agent Runtime use. 
          * Files: Uploaded during Agent Runtime setup or as part of a message.  
      - question: |
          Where is this data stored?
        answer: |
          Data is stored in a secure, Microsoft-managed storage account that is logically separated.  
      - question: |
          How long is this data stored?
        answer: |
          All used data persists in this system unless you explicitly delete this data. Use the [delete function](./Agent Runtime-reference-threads.md) with the thread ID of the thread you want to delete. Clearing the Run in the Agent Runtime Playground does not delete threads, however deleting them using delete function will not list them in the thread page. 
      - question: |
          Can I bring my own data store to use with Agent Runtime? 
        answer: |
          No. Currently Agent Runtime supports only local files uploaded to the Agent Runtime-managed storage. You cannot use your private storage account with Agent Runtime. 
      - question: | 
          Does Agent Runtime support customer-managed key encryption (CMK)?
        answer: |
          Today we support CMK for Threads and Files in Agent Runtime. See the [What's new page](./whats-new.md#customer-managed-key-cmk-support-for-Agent Runtime) for available regions for this feature.
      - question: |
          Is my data used by Microsoft for training models? 
        answer: |
          No. Data is not used for Microsoft not used for training models. See the [Responsible AI documentation](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) for more information. 
      - question: |
          Where is data stored geographically?
        answer: |
          Azure OpenAI Agent Runtime endpoints are regional, and data is stored in the same region as the endpoint. For more information, see the [Azure data residency documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/data-residency/#overview). 
      - question: |
          How am I charged for Agent Runtime?
        answer: |
          * Inference cost (input and output) of the base model you're using for each Assistant (for example gpt-4-0125). If you've created multiple Agent Runtime, you will be charged for the base model attached to each Assistant.
          * If you've enabled the Code Interpreter tool. For example if your assistant calls Code Interpreter simultaneously in two different threads, this would create two Code Interpreter sessions, each of which would be charged. Each session is active by default for one hour, which means that you would only pay this fee once if your user keeps giving instructions to Code Interpreter in the same thread for up to one hour.
          * File search is billed based on the vector storage used. 

          For more information, see the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/).
      - question: |
          Is there any additional pricing or quota for using Agent Runtime? 
        answer: |
          No. All [quotas](./quotas-limits.md) apply to using models with Agent Runtime.
      - question: |
          Does the Agent Runtime API support non-Azure OpenAI models?   
        answer: |
          Agent Runtime API only supports Azure OpenAI models.
      - question: |
          Is the Agent Runtime API generally available?
        answer: |
          The Agent Runtime API is currently in public preview. Stay informed of our latest product updates by regularly visiting our [What's New](./whats-new.md) page.

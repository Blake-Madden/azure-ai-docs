# What are Azure AI Translator prebuilt solutions?

 Azure AI Translator prebuilt solutions empower you to seamlessly integrate translation capabilities and AI intelligence into applications and workflows across all [supported languages](language-support.md). These ready-to-use solutions provide a quick and efficient way to integrate translation features and capabilities into your applications, eliminating the need to develop code and train models.

Azure AI Translator offers the following prebuilt solutions:

* [**Language Studio**](document-translation/language-studio.md). Azure AI Translator in the [Azure AI Language Studio](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/home) is a no-code user interface that lets you interactively translate documents from local or Azure Blob Storage. 
* [**Translator V3 connector for documents**](connector/document-translation-flow.md) and [**Translator V3 connector for text**](connector/text-translation-flow.md). The Microsoft Translator V3 connectors create a link between your Translator Service instance and Microsoft Power Automate enabling you to incorporate one or more prebuilt operations into your apps and workflows.
* [**Microsoft Translator Pro**](translator-pro/overview.md). Microsoft Translator Pro is an advanced mobile application, designed specifically for enterprises, that enables seamless speech-to-speech translation in real time.
